# How It Works Now - No Setup Required!

## ✅ It Works Immediately

**The app works RIGHT NOW with localStorage** - no setup needed!

- ✅ **Saves work immediately** - uses browser localStorage
- ✅ **All features work** - create, edit, review, approve SOPs
- ✅ **No GitHub setup required** - works out of the box

---

## 🔄 Optional: Cross-Device Sync (One-Time Setup)

If you want SOPs to sync across devices, create ONE repository:

1. Go to: https://github.com/recorpproduction-prog
2. Click "New" → Name: `recorp-sops-data` → Private → Create
3. That's it! The app will automatically start syncing

**If you don't create the repo:**
- ✅ App still works perfectly
- ✅ Uses localStorage (works on that device)
- ✅ All features work

**If you create the repo:**
- ✅ SOPs sync to GitHub automatically
- ✅ All devices see the same SOPs
- ✅ Cross-device access works

## Current Status

**Primary Storage:** localStorage (always works)
**Optional Sync:** GitHub (if repository exists)

The app works either way!
