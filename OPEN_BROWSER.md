# Server is Running!

## Your web app is now available at:

**http://localhost:5000**

## To Open:

1. **Automatic:** Browser should open automatically in 2 seconds
2. **Manual:** Open your browser and go to:
   - http://localhost:5000 (main page)
   - http://localhost:5000/review (review page)

## If Browser Didn't Open:

1. Open any browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Go to: http://localhost:5000
3. You should see the Pallet Ticket Capture page

## Troubleshooting:

**If page doesn't load:**
- Make sure server is still running (don't close the command window)
- Try: http://127.0.0.1:5000
- Try: http://10.10.60.68:5000 (your local IP)

**If you see an error:**
- Check the command window for error messages
- Make sure port 5000 is not already in use

## The Server Must Stay Running

- Keep the command window open
- Don't close it while using the app
- Press Ctrl+C in the command window to stop the server
