# Worksite Access – View & Edit SOPs on Any Device

## No app login

**There is no username/password for the SOP tool.** Anyone with the link can open the app. You do not need to “log in” to the app itself.

## How shared SOPs work

SOPs are stored in **one shared Google Drive folder**. Every device that “connects” to that folder sees the same list and can view and edit the same SOPs.

- **One-time setup (per device):** On each phone, tablet, or computer, open the app and connect to Google Drive **once**.
- **After that:** That device will see all shared SOPs and can view/edit PDFs and the register without logging in again.

So it’s not “log in on every device” – it’s **“Connect to Google Drive once on each device”**. After that, access is there for viewing and editing.

## Using the app on your phone

1. **Open the same URL** you use on a computer, e.g.  
   `https://recorpproduction-prog.github.io/RECORPSOPTOOL/`  
   (or whatever your actual app URL is).

2. **First time on this phone:**  
   - Tap **☁️ Drive** (top right).  
   - If needed, enter **Client ID** and **API Key** (get these once from your admin and paste them in; you can leave Folder ID empty).  
   - Tap **Save Configuration**, then **Connect to Google Drive**.  
   - Sign in with Google **once** when asked.  
   - After that, the app will show the shared SOPs on this phone.

3. **Next times:** Just open the link. You should see the same SOPs; no need to connect again unless you’ve cleared the browser or signed out.

4. **Optional – quick access:**  
   - **iPhone:** In Safari, tap Share → “Add to Home Screen”.  
   - **Android:** In Chrome, tap Menu (⋮) → “Add to Home screen” or “Install app”.  
   Then you can open the SOP tool like an app from your home screen.

## Why “Connect” once per device?

The app runs in the browser and uses Google Drive to store SOPs. Each device (phone, tablet, PC) has its own browser storage. So each device must do the **one-time “Connect to Google Drive”** so that:

- That browser is allowed to read/write the shared folder.
- The app on that device can load and save the same SOPs as everyone else.

There is no separate “app account” to log into – only this one-time Google connection per device.

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Do people need to log in to the app? | No. There is no app login. |
| Do they need to do something on each device? | Yes. **Once per device:** open the app → ☁️ Drive → Connect to Google Drive. |
| Can they just view and edit PDFs after that? | Yes. After connecting once, they can view and edit SOPs and PDFs on that device without logging in again. |
| How do they get the app on their phone? | Open the same URL in the phone’s browser; optionally add to home screen for quick access. |

If the app does not load on your phone, check that you’re using the correct URL (same as on desktop) and that your network allows access to GitHub Pages (and Google, for Drive).
